Another day, another schema...

See the culprit http://coogradio.com/schedule (it's an image housing list data). One might 
think of it as tabular data, since calendar data is usually rendered so. But this is not a 
calendar, as it is only a subset of the calendar. The authors only wish to describe a daily 
playlist. This is their primary content (to be applied "orbitally"). Users, for instance, 
may be interested in searching by day, above any other filter ("What day did she play?"). 
Something cool might emerge when one renders all the Friday "daylist" DJs to develop a 
top ten list of Friday night freaks, or metadaylists -- Top five DJs top five metal tracks.

It's not about tables. It's about lists. Schematize it, and you'll see a lot more meaning.

Obviously Google Maps should offer a UI hook for playing a short preview clip within the 
tooltips of radio stations. Obviously. It's hypermedia data at heart.

##Tech Stack

I'd probably do it in Python, or SammyJS. It really doesn't need a backend. Manage it all 
with markdown files and front-end (JS/SASS).
