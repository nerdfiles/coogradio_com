#Schema Expression Markdown

A markdown strategy for quickly rendering conceptions of new models and thought 
experiments to be integrated into schema.org valid systems.

##Markdown Presentation

It's a simple point to make, but name{.sem} should render in markdown presenters,
like Byword, etc. It's just the assumption of "description" followed by "example". 
Think of it as "schemadoc" (a la cssdoc, jsdoc, javadoc). It's a schematizing 
thought-pattern for thinking about things and their analogies with other things.
